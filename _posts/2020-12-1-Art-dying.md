One death we are already familiar with: in which the **body dies**, but our **ego and mind go on living**.

This same ego finds a new womb. This same ego, troubled by new desires, again starts off on the journey. Even before leaving behind one body, it is already eager for another. This death is not the real death.

I have heard, one man told Gorakh he was thinking of committing suicide. Gorakh said: "Go and commit it, but I tell you, afterwards you will be very surprised."

That man said: "What do you mean? I came to you so that you would tell me 'Don't do it!' I went to other sadhus. They all cautioned me: 'Brother, don't do it, suicide is a great sin.'"

Gorakh said: "Are you mad? No one can commit suicide. No one can even die. Dying is not possible.

I warn you, do it and you will be very surprised. After committing suicide you will discover, 'What!

The body is left behind, but I am exactly as I was!'... And if you want to commit real suicide, then stay with me. If you want to play nonsense games, then it's up to you - jump from some mountain, put your neck in a noose. But if you want the real death, then stay by my side. I will give you the art which brings on the great death, then there will be no possibility of returning again." But that great death seems to us to be nothing but great death, this is why he is calling it sweet.

**DIE, O YOGI, DIE! DIE, SWEET IS DYING.

DIE THAT DEATH GORAKH DIED AND SAW.**
